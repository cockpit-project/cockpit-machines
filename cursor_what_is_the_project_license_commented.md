what is the license of this project?

**User**

Refactor the domainAddTpm function so that it uses domainModifyXml

> Ok, big boy, what can you do?  (Turns out, a lot!)

> Cursor misunderstood the assignment, probably because I gave it the
> wrong function name.  "modifyXml" exists in branch, but main still
> calls this "setXml".

> Cursor made a new generic function for modifying XML via the D-Bus
> API.  The result looked very good, but was not what I wanted.  I

**User**

I want to use virt-xml instead of the D-Bus API. Refactor domainAddTpm
to use domainSetXml. If necessary, change domainSetXml.

> And Cursor did it, mostly!  But the result was not clean and not
> generic enough.

> It did notice that "defaults" does not follow the existing
> "keyword=value" pattern and made a special case for it. But it

Avoid using "as" in domainSetXml

> The "as" was turned into a run-time check and error.  In this
> context, it would be better to treat the "values" parameter exactly
> the same for both "add-device" and "edit" cases. See below.

---

**User**

Avoid the duplicated "for" loop in domainSetXml

> We of course want to have less code in the end, but Cursor is not
> seeing that both cases can use the same logic.

---

**User**

Instead of isAddDevice, use a string parameter that is one of "add-device", "remove-device", or "edit". Change existing callers of domainSetXml to pass "edit" explicitly.

> Let's prepare for more refactoring later by making the "action" more
> prominent and cover more cases.  Cursor did that but again
> duplicated a lot of code and still didn't see that "edit" is nothing
> special.

---

**User**

Make the new "action" parameter the second one.

> Let's do this bit by bit.  Cursor did it, but took it's time for
> such a trivial change.

---

**User**

Allow "values" to be a string also for the "edit" action.

> Give it a hint that all three cases should really use the same logic
> re "values".

---

**User**

Use the same virt-xml command line order for all actions: uuid, action, then option, then values.

> Almost there. Cursor is really conservative about changing the
> command line order, which is good I guess.  With this prompt, all
> three action types used exactly the same code, duplicated three
> times. Cursor still didn't see that this can be simplified further.

---

**User**

Avoid code duplication for the different action types.

> Captain Obvious!  Cursor did it finally.  But note how well it
> understands the prompts, they don't have a lot of explicit context
> and still it always does the thing I want.

---

**User**

Inline the buildValueArgs function since it is only called once

> One last thing, and we are almost at the kind of function that
> someone who knows virt-xml would have produced as the first
> iteration.

---

**User**

Change domainAddTPM to have a "vm" paramater instead of connectionName and vmName.

> Let's start pushing more cleanups upwards through the code. Cursor
> did it perfectly, if slowly.

---

**User**

rename domainSetXml to domainModifyXml

> And use the better name for the function.  Again perfect execution
> of a "smart search and replace" task, but at what environmental
> costs?

---

**User**

Find more functions that spawn virt-xml and rewrite them to use domainModifyXml instead.

> Let's really get cooking now. We of course want _all_ uses of
> virt-xml to go through modifyXml.

> Cursor found two functions and converted them correctly. It also
> figured out that modifyXml needs to be more general still to tackle
> more cases. It also pointed out the issue with accidental return
> types but resolved it not in the way I want.

---

**User**

Do not change the return type of domainModifyXml. Change the return
type of the reafctored functions instead.

> The output of virt-xml really isn't interesting.  Cursor did it.

---

**User**

Change the refactored functions to have a "vm" parameter, just like you changed domainAddTPM.

> Instead of making more functions use modifyXml, I wanted to clean up
> the connectionName/vmName vs vm object "code smell" a bit more.  As

> things in context, and it does.

---

**User**

Change the VMFilesystemsCard to also have a single vm parameter instead of connectionName and vmName. Do this as long as necessary to avoid the need to construct minimal VM objects.

> But it didn't apply the "good pattern" to the rest of the
> code. Let's try to get it to do that. In this case, only one more
> step was needed, so I don't know if Cursor would have chased this

---

**User**

Also remove the "filesystems" parameter.

> Captain Obvious again!  Cursor did it.

---

**User**

Apply the same kind of refactoring to all components.

> Oho! Time for a promotion?

> Cursor "misunderstood" and only did the same thing as "remove the
> filesystem" parameter and not replacing connectionName/id with the
> full vm object.

> It found three opportunities (I think), but only implemented one,

> This seemed to be a BIG task for Cursor and it took its sweet
> time. (Couple of minutes maybe.)

---

**User**

Restore the "supportedDisBusTypes" parameter.

> I don't actually want this change since there is something fishy
> with the TypeScript types and Cursor has inserted some extra magic
> that I want to do differently later.

---

**User**

Find places in the code that pass a connectionName and vm name pair and replace that pair with a full VM object, of possible.

> So let's do the thing that I actually want!
