# cockpit-machines


This is the [Cockpit](https://cockpit-project.org/) user interface for virtual machines.

## Technologies

- [libvirt-dbus](https://libvirt.org/dbus.html) for enumerating machines, getting status
  update notifications, and operations such as start/stop/delete
- [virt-install](https://manpages.org/virt-install) and [virt-xml](https://manpages.org/virt-xml)
  for creating and modifying machine definitions; both part of the
  [virt-manager](https://virt-manager.org/) project

# Getting and building the source

Make sure you have `npm` available (usually from your distribution package).
These commands check out the source and build it into the `dist/` directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines
cd cockpit-machines
make
```

# Installing

`sudo make install` installs the package in `/usr/share/cockpit/`. This depends
on the `dist` target, which generates the distribution tarball.

You can also run `make rpm` to build RPMs for local installation.

In `production` mode, source files are automatically minified and compressed.
Set `NODE_ENV=production` if you want to duplicate this behavior.

# Development instructions

See [HACKING.md](./HACKING.md) for details about how to efficiently change the
code, run, and test it.

# Automated release

The intention is that the only manual step for releasing a project is to create
a signed tag for the version number, which includes a summary of the noteworthy
changes:

```
123

- this new feature
- fix bug #123
```

Pushing the release tag triggers the [release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)
[GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions) workflow. This creates the
official release tarball and publishes as upstream release to GitHub.

The Fedora and COPR releases are done with [Packit](https://packit.dev/),
see the [packit.yaml](./packit.yaml) control file.

# Automated maintenance

It is important to keep your [NPM modules](./package.json) up to date, to keep
up with security updates and bug fixes. This is done with the
[npm-update bot script](https://github.com/cockpit-project/bots/blob/main/npm-update)
which is run weekly or upon [manual request](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit-machines/actions) through the
[npm-update.yml](.github/workflows/npm-update.yml) [GitHub action](https://github.com/features/actions).

Similarly, translations are refreshed every Tuesday evening (or manually) through the
[weblate-sync-po.yml](.github/workflows/weblate-sync-po.yml) action.
Conversely, the PO template is uploaded to weblate every day through the
[weblate-sync-pot.yml](.github/workflows/weblate-sync-pot.yml) action.
